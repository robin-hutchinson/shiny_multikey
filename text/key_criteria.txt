On the wings, vein 3 is forked at the tip, and veins 5 and 6 do not bend towards each other.
There are fewer than 10 hairs on the dorsal face of vein 3.
The tibiae do not have any isolated bristles, except apically.
The hind tibia has a single dorsal palisade, with a row of bristle-like hairs on each side.
The mesopleural furrow is present.
In males, the hairs on the proctiger are more robust than the hairs on the cerci.
Females only have tergites on abdominal segments 1 to 4, and have a small papilla on each side of abdominal tergite 3, near the margin.
